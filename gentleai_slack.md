    1. You will have to provide your email address and Slack will send you a confirmation email which you can click to sign up and join.
    2. Go through the sign up screen and hit “skip for now” when you are asked to invite teammates. 
    3. Check in your junk mail folder if you can’t find the Slack confirmation email. 
    4. Join the Slack channel. Click on “channels” (not the plus) and join day1, day2, day3, and group_projects channels etc. ![channel](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9a/Join-a-Channel-on-Slack-Step-2.jpg/aid7979219-v4-728px-Join-a-Channel-on-Slack-Step-2.jpg.webp)
    5. Say hi, post something!
    5. Each day, given the limited time we have, post any questions in the corresponding channel. 
    6. Remember to use “thread” if you are commenting on someone else’s comment. This helps others read the original comment and responses more easily ![thread](https://i2.wp.com/davechen.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/slack.png?resize=700%2C483)
