## Day 0 Materials
### This one is optional but if you have few minutes on the weekend  I want to know a bit about you even if you want to stay anonymous. Please go [here](https://goo.gl/forms/5Y5FXFI15fyq2ve93) to start

### Getting Started
1. We will be using Slack for Qs and As, discussion and the group project, Google Apps Script for coding, Watson, and Google Drive to access the documents used for this course.
1. Click on this [Slack invite](https://join.slack.com/t/learnin60/shared_invite/enQtMzU2NTAxODQ2Njk1LTYyM2ZiMjRhMWNjZGQyNjZkZjc4Zjk0NTY2MDY2OGM3NWQzNGNhY2NmOTljMTQxY2ZjNmIwNTEzMmZmNDdjNjQ) 
    1. You will have to provide your email address and Slack will send you a confirmation email which you can click to sign up and join.
    2. Go through the sign up screen and hit “skip for now” when you are asked to invite teammates. 
    3. Check in your junk mail folder if you can’t find the Slack confirmation email. 
    4. Join the Slack channel. Click on “channels” (not the plus) and join day1, day2, day3, and group_projects channels etc. ![channel](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9a/Join-a-Channel-on-Slack-Step-2.jpg/aid7979219-v4-728px-Join-a-Channel-on-Slack-Step-2.jpg.webp)
    5. Say hi, post something!
    5. Each day, given the limited time we have, post any questions in the corresponding channel. 
    6. Remember to use “thread” if you are commenting on someone else’s comment. This helps others read the original comment and responses more easily ![thread](https://i2.wp.com/davechen.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/slack.png?resize=700%2C483)

## Annex 
Email
Dear Fellow AI enthusiasts



You are receiving this email because you have registered for the course: A very gentle (and hands-on) interaction with an AI for ITS staff only. 
 
Welcome to the course everyone and a special welcome to the 25 CO staff! I am looking forward to seeing and meeting you all on Monday. It is a very short course and the participant's technical background is diverse (we have no prerequisites). Therefore we need to do a bit of bootstrapping to ensure this course is useful and fun for all the participants regardless of their technical background. Here's what you need to get there:


 
Room numbers and webex links

Getting the most out of this course
This course covers a lot in a short time so here are a few suggestions to get the most out of it
1.	Please plan to join via webex since the classroom size (other than the first day) is small. Or plan to arrive early. Slack, a collaboration tool, will help us deal well with the size and the virtual aspect of the class (see below for more)
2.	Please have your laptops or computers in front of you as you will need it
3.	Please be sure you have a gmail account
4.	Try to complete Day 0 as per the project website (below)
5.	Please plan to spend about an hour a day after class hours, trying out what you reviewed in class.





 
Using Slack
Slack is becoming an integral part of virtual classrooms and the workplace. It is a virtual space where you can ask questions, get answers and communicate with each other. Channels are the equivalent of an online forum topic. 



We have set up a Slack space with multiple channels for this course. Join the Slack space here, join all the channels you want. Each day post the questions you have in the corresponding channel (ideally publicly). Please do answer questions that others have posed too if you think you can. This will extend the class beyond the three hours but give us a full one hour of class time each day. It also makes the learning experience more collaborative which is specially designed for CO or other remote staff. Instructions on how to use slack are on the course home page below

Who you are
I am curious to find out about your motivation for joining this course.  So if you have a few minutes this weekend, I would really appreciate your completing this survey **deleted**.  It is very short, you can be anonymous but it may be fun and useful to do so. 



Course Home page
We have a webpage for the course on Github. You can find all the materials there and also some instructions for getting started on Slack. The url is https://tanyagupta.github.io/gentleai 
 
Look forward to meeting each and everyone of you

Tanya
