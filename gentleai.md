### Getting Started
1. We will be using Slack for Qs and As, discussion and the group project, Google Apps Script for coding, Watson, and Google Drive to access the documents used for this course.
1. Click on this [Slack invite](https://join.slack.com/t/learnin60/shared_invite/enQtMzU2NTAxODQ2Njk1LTYyM2ZiMjRhMWNjZGQyNjZkZjc4Zjk0NTY2MDY2OGM3NWQzNGNhY2NmOTljMTQxY2ZjNmIwNTEzMmZmNDdjNjQ) 
    1. You will have to provide your email address and Slack will send you a confirmation email which you can click to sign up and join.
    2. Go through the sign up screen and hit “skip for now” when you are asked to invite teammates. 
    3. Check in your junk mail folder if you can’t find the Slack confirmation email. 
    4. Join the Slack channel. Click on “channels” (not the plus) and join day1, day2, day3, and group_projects channel
    5. Say hi, post something!
    5. Each day, given the limited time we have, post any questions in the corresponding channel. 
    6. Remember to use “thread” if you are commenting on someone else’s comment. This helps others read the original comment and responses more easily
